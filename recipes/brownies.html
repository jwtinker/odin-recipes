            </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 (17.6-oz) bag miniature chocolate peanut butter cups, such as Reeses</li>
                <li>5 large eggs</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line an 8x8 baking
                    dish with parchment and lightly coat with cooking spray.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Place peanut butter cups in a medium microwave-safe bowl and microwave
                    in 30 second intervals, stirring in between, about 2 minutes total, until
                    smooth. Let cool slightly.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Using an electric mixer or whisk, beat eggs until frothy. Slowly drizzle 
                    in chocolate while mixing until well incorporated. Pour batter into 
                    prepared pan.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in center 
                    comes out clean, 22 to 26 minutes. Let cool completely before cutting.
                </li>
