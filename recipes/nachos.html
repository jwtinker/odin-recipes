        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    For taco seasoning, stir paprika, garlic powder, cumin, onion powder, 
                    chili powder, oregano, and salt together in a small bowl; set aside.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir 
                    ground beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly 5 to 7
                    minutes. Stir in onion and green pepper; cook and stir with oil
                    and juices from browned meat until much of the liquid has evaporated, 
                    about 2 minutes more.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Stir 1/2 can diced tomatoes with chilies and Mexican-style corn into 
                    skillet. Season beef mixture to taste with prepared taco seasoning mix.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Stir together the remaining 1/2 can diced tomatoes with chilies and 
                    refried beans in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave on High until heated 
                    through, stirring every 30 seconds, 1 to 3 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    To assemble nachos, lay half of tortilla chips in a single layer on a 
                    microwave-safe plate, then drop teaspoons of refried beans onto chips, 
                    followed by meat mixture and shredded cheese. Repeat with remaining chips, 
                    beans, meat, and cheese to make a second layer.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Microwave on High until cheese is melted and nachos are warm, 2 to 3 minutes. 
                    Top with sour cream, salsa, olives, jalapenos, and green onion as delivered.
                </li>
            </ol>
