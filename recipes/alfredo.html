        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                A great dish made with bow-tie pasta. Serves 2 to 4 and goes great with 
                a side salad or bread. Also a great side with grilled chicken or shrimp.
            </p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>4 ounces of farfalle (bow-tie) pasta</li>
                <li>2 cups fresh broccoli florets</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
                <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
                <li>3/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese (see note)</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
                <li>1 pinch ground nutmeg, or to taste</li>
                <li>salt and freshly ground pepper to taste</li>
                <li>fresh parsley sprigs for garnish (optional)</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook farfalle 
                    pasta at a boil, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the 
                    bite, about 12 minutes. Remove to a colander; reserve the pasta water 
                    for later use.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add broccoli to a microwave-safe container along with 1/4 cup water. 
                    Cover and cook on High until bright green and tender with a bite, about 
                    4 minutes. Drain; season with salt. Keep warm.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Meanwhile, melt butter in a skillet or saucepan over low heat. Stir in 
                    cream and allow to simmer, stirring often, 3 to 4 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add cheese to garlic, stirring continously, until cheese is melted. Stir 
                    in nutmeg and remove from heat. If sauce is too thick, stir in a bit of 
                    reserved pasta water. Season to taste with salt and pepper.
                </li>
                <li>
                    To serve, combine cooked pasta, cooked broccoli, and sauce. Garnish with 
                    fresh parsley sprigs, if desired.
                </li>
            </ol>
